# Lee CASE1 whitebox challenge

The binary and table were kindly provided by Seungkwang Lee <skwang@etri.re.kr>, author of

As explained in the paper, they have three cases (CASE1, CASE2, and CASE3) according to the security requirement level.

The binary is to lookup the table (TAB.bin) that was generated by the principle of CASE 1.

Components
----------

* `target` contains the binary and table and instructions how to use tem, as well as the solution (the key to recover).
* `traces` contains explanations on how to acquire a visual trace and snapshots.
