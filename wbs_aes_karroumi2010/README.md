# Karroumi challenge

There is no official challenge so we made our own based on the implementation written by Dušan Klinec as part of his thesis.

Ref: https://github.com/ph4r05/Whitebox-crypto-AES

Components
----------

* `target` contains a compiled version and instructions how to use it, as well as the solution (the key to recover).
* `traces` contains explanations on how to acquire a visual trace and snapshots used in the tutorial.
* `DCA` contains the DCA attack against this challenge.
* `DFA` contains the DFA attack against this challenge.
* `BGE` contains the BGE attack against this challenge.

See the projet wiki for the corresponding tutorial.

Other write-ups
---------------

It was not a real challenge, but remember we used the implementation of Dušan Klinec who has shown how to apply BGE against it, so check his work too:
