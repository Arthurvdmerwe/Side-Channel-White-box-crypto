# OpenWhiteBox AES Full challenge

There is no official challenge so we made our own based on the implementation available from the OpenWhiteBox project.

Ref: https://github.com/OpenWhiteBox/AES

Components
----------

* `target` contains compiled versions (with remotely-applied and locally-applied external encodings), instructions how to compile them by yourself, and instructions how to use it, as well as the solution (the key to recover).
* `traces` contains explanations on how to acquire a visual trace and snapshots used in the tutorial.

Other write-ups
